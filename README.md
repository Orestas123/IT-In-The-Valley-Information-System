# IT In The Valley Information System
This applciation was made by following a case study. 
It was made for a Magazine Editor, who can create and manage Magazines. 
Application supports advertisement/media storage, where ads and media can be stored in one place, and then added to a magazine page. 
New magazines can be easily created by using a page generator (html based).
The ads and media which Editor want's to include in the magazine page can be selected from the ads/media storage. 
Ads and page content have different places in the page.

## This app isn't perfect and needs imrovements, however it has fulfilled my task and was enough to receive a good mark for the assignment.
